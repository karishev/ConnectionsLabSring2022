# Website about Arduino Tiles project

This porject was made in 2020, July as a final project for "Introduction to Interactive Media" class. The project is a game that has a two-way connection with Arduino and Processing and the game mechanics are as in the Piano Tiles game. I decided to go with this project, since I have a video and some photos from the production period. I decided to go minimalistic with everything on one page, since there is nothing much to talk about this project. I also added some <span> that are from 'iconify' library. You can see the website <a href="https://61f712d1290c89a93e304f82--frosty-nightingale-b14b21.netlify.app/"> here </a>
