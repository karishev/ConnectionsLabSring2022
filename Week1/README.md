#Shared Piano reflection

I picked the web application called ‘Shared Piano’. I was impressed just by the simple fact that the piano works just alone on a website, but then the professor showed us that it is possible to have multiple people play the piano together. My first idea was the meme song called ‘Rush E’, which is basically impossible to play alone, only a simplified version. You can actually see people trying to play the song on YouTube to understand the context. In my opinion, using an interactive piano for this challenge is an interesting approach.


In my opinion, the application can be used on various occasions, such as playing for fun with friends, recording music. It is possible even to learn some easy parts for fun and as a first experience. Of course, it is not enough for playing hard pieces, because the keyboard can’t cover the whole keys of the piano. However, the app even tries to create new challenges, because there are some keys that allow you to move the area that you can play by octave left or right. It is a feature that can allow one person to play the left, while the second person plays the right-hand part. It also can create some challenges where people try to play a song while moving the octave left and right. Of course, it would take time and dedication to master this skill, but there are many challenges in the media when people try something impossible and challenge others, like speed runs of games.


I believe that the website is intuitively understandable for the users, therefore the UI part is working perfectly. The only flaw is the change of the octave buttons since they sometimes go beyond the visible scope of the piano. However, the ‘Help’ button explains everything and it is recommended to look into it before using the application. In my opinion, such a complex instrument as a piano, implemented in a website needs a ‘help’ button, therefore I do not think it is a flaw since most parts are intuitively clear.


To summarize my points, the ‘Shared Piano’ application is working perfectly as it is intended to do. It can be used to teach someone new to the piano world, play with friends, explore the possibilities that it can present and be creative with any challenges that you can think of.
